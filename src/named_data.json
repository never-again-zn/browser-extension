Teva stands with Israel and provides all kind of medical, pharmaceutical and humanitarian aid to the zionist. Note: Hospitals in Gaza are facing a shortage of medical supplies. Humanitarian aid is based on the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, and independence. The principle of humanity entails taking initiatives to alleviate human suffering, regardless of where it occurs, with particular attention to the most vulnerable. The dignity of all victims must be respected and protected. The principle of impartiality means that humanitarian aid can only be provided based on need, without discrimination between or within affected ethnic groups. ",
